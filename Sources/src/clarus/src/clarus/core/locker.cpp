    notify() is called, tally and notch will have different values, and the wait
    will end.

    This scheme allows several Lockers to each call wait() on the same Locker
    object, and be assured that they will be released from the wait after notify()
    is called, even if wait() is called again before the Locker checks the
    notification state.
