    Performs binary dithering in the input image, using the given threshold.

    Arguments:

    image
        Input image. If multi-channel, dithering is performed channel-wise.

    threshold
        Pixel values bigger than the threshold are converted to 255, the others to 0.

    Returns:

    Pixel matrix of type CV_8UC* with the values dithered down to the binary set {0, 255}.

    algorithm.

    Arguments:

    image
        Input image. If multi-channel, dithering is performed channel-wise.

    bits
        "Virtual" bit depth of the output image (or its channels if multi-channel).
        This bit depth is "virtual" in the sense that the output *type* is actually
        unsigned char (and hence 8 bits long), but the number of distinct *values*
        returned is such that they could be indexed using this many bits.

    Returns:

    Pixel matrix of type CV_8UC* with the values dithered down to the given bit depth.
