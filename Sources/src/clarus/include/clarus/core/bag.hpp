\brief An heterogeneous container.

A bag is a collection of string-indexed values. Contrary to most containers, values
are not restricted to belonging to the same class, not even to a common superclass.
Template methods enable values of arbitrary types to be stored to and retrieved from
the collection; the user is required to remember which type is associated to each
string key and use the proper template parameters when retrieving stored values,
though.
